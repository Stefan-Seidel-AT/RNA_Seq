#This project and code is based on a tutorial of RNA Sequence Analysis by Siva Chudalayandi 
 as (found on https://bioinformaticsworkbook.org/dataAnalysis/RNA-Seq/RNA-SeqIntro/RNAseq-using-a-genome.html#gsc.tab=0 )
 and the code (slightly) adapted by Stefan Seidel

 The following folder structure is used:
	/data        \\ contains processed data
		/aligned
		/annotated
		/fastqc
		/plot
	/literature  \\ contains literature
	/rawdata     \\ contain rawdata
	/scripts     \\ contain scripts

"RNA_seq_image.sh" starts a docker container for R to analize data preprocessed by the scripts in the folder "\scripts"

 "\scripts" contains a file containin links for download of the data, and scripts for processing the data
